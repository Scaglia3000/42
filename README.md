## 1 - Piscine Reloaded

Selection of exercices from the "piscine" month at 42.

## 2 - libft

Subject:

*C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C projects. Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.*



## 3 - Get Next Line

Subject:

*You are now starting to understand that it will get tricky to read data from a file descriptor if you don’t know its size beforehand. What size should your buffer be? How many times do you need to read the file descriptor to retrieve the data ? It is perfectly normal and natural that, as a programmer, you would want to read a “line” that ends with a line break from a file descriptor. For example each command that you type in your shell or each line read from a flat file. Thanks to the project get_next_line, you will finally be able to write a function that will allow you to read a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor. You’ll be able to add this function to your libft if you feel like it and most importantly, use it in all the future projects that will require it.*
